# Epic: GitHub Copilot MCP Bridge Extension

## Overview
Create a VS Code extension that enables GitHub Copilot to connect to and utilize MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, providing Copilot with enhanced capabilities similar to Claude Desktop's MCP integration.

## Business Value
- Extends GitHub Copilot's capabilities beyond code completion
- Allows developers to leverage existing MCP servers with Copilot
- Creates a unified development experience with external tools and data sources
- Enables custom tool integration without modifying Copilot itself

## Technical Overview
The extension will act as a middleware layer that:
1. Intercepts and augments Copilot's context
2. Manages connections to MCP servers
3. Translates between Copilot's extension API and MCP protocol
4. Provides UI for server configuration and management

## Key Features
- MCP server discovery and connection management
- Context injection into Copilot prompts
- Tool execution through Copilot chat interface
- Configuration UI for MCP servers
- Security and permission management
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Copilot can access MCP server tools through natural language
- [ ] Extension supports multiple simultaneous MCP connections
- [ ] Minimal performance impact on Copilot's response time
- [ ] Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data
- [ ] Published to VS Code marketplace
- [ ] Documentation and examples provided

## Dependencies
- VS Code Extension API
- GitHub Copilot Extension API
- MCP Protocol specification
- TypeScript/Node.js ecosystem

## Risks
- Copilot API limitations may restrict integration points
- Performance overhead of middleware layer
- Security concerns with third-party MCP servers
- Potential conflicts with Copilot's built-in features
