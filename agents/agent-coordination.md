# Agent Coordination Protocol

## Overview
This document defines how agents work together to build the Copilot-MCP Bridge extension in parallel while maintaining code quality and integration.

## Agent Roles Summary

| Agent | Primary Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Project management, coordination | Task assignment, progress tracking |
| **Backend** | Core extension logic, MCP protocol | Extension scaffold, MCP client |
| **Frontend** | UI/UX, webviews, user interaction | Configuration UI, status indicators |
| **Integration** | Copilot API integration | Chat participant, context providers |
| **Testing** | Quality assurance, test coverage | Test suites, mocks, benchmarks |
| **DevOps** | CI/CD, release management | Pipelines, automation, monitoring |

```

## Communication Channels

### 1. Status Updates
```yaml
# Daily standup format (posted to agents/daily-status.md)
agent: backend
date: 2024-01-15
completed:
  - Extension scaffold created
  - TypeScript configuration done
working_on:
  - MCP client implementation
blockers:
  - Need types from integration agent
dependencies:
  - integration/types-definition
```

### 2. Dependency Management
```yaml
# Posted to agents/dependencies.yaml
dependencies:
  backend/mcp-types:
    required_by: [frontend, integration, testing]
    status: completed
    location: src/types/mcp.ts
    
  frontend/webview-api:
    required_by: [integration]
    status: in_progress
    eta: 2024-01-16
```

### 3. Integration Points
```yaml
# Posted to agents/integration-points.yaml
integration_points:
  mcp_manager_api:
    provider: backend
    consumers: [frontend, integration]
    interface: src/mcp/manager.ts
    
  chat_participant_registration:
    provider: integration
    consumers: [frontend]
    interface: src/copilot/chatParticipant.ts
```

## Code Integration Strategy

### 1. Branch Management
```bash
main
├── develop
│   ├── feature/backend-core
│   ├── feature/frontend-ui
│   ├── feature/copilot-integration
│   ├── feature/testing-infrastructure
│   └── feature/devops-infrastructure
└── release/1.0.0
```

### 2. Merge Strategy
1. **Daily Integration**: Merge to develop branch
2. **Feature Complete**: Create release branch
3. **Testing Phase**: Fix bugs in release branch
4. **Release**: Merge to main and tag

### 3. Conflict Resolution
```yaml
conflict_resolution:
  priority_order:
    1: Types and interfaces (backend)
    2: Core functionality (backend/integration)
    3: UI components (frontend)
    4: Tests (testing)
    5: Build configuration (devops)
    
  resolution_process:
    1: Detect conflict in CI
    2: Notify affected agents
    3: Orchestrator mediates
    4: Implement agreed solution
```

## Quality Gates

### 1. Pre-Merge Checks
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Security scan clean

### 2. Integration Checks
- [ ] All agent branches merge cleanly
- [ ] E2E tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Agent Synchronization Points

### Critical Sync Points
1. **Type Definitions** (Day 2)
   - Backend provides core types
   - All agents adopt types

2. **API Interfaces** (Day 4)
   - Define all public APIs
   - Lock interfaces

3. **Integration Testing** (Day 8)
   - All features ready
   - Begin integration

4. **Release Candidate** (Day 10)
   - Feature freeze
   - Focus on stability

## Artifact Sharing

### Shared Resources Location
```
agents/shared/
├── types/          # Shared TypeScript types
├── mocks/          # Shared mock implementations
├── fixtures/       # Test fixtures
├── docs/           # API documentation
└── schemas/        # JSON schemas
```

### Update Protocol
1. Agent creates/updates shared resource
2. Posts update to `agents/updates.log`
3. Other agents pull changes
4. Acknowledge receipt

## Success Metrics

### Per-Agent Metrics
- **Backend**: API completeness, performance
- **Frontend**: UI responsiveness, accessibility
- **Integration**: Copilot compatibility, response time
- **Testing**: Coverage percentage, test stability
- **DevOps**: Build time, deployment success rate

### Overall Project Metrics
- All tickets completed
- Integration tests passing
- Performance targets met
- Documentation complete
- Ready for marketplace submission

## Escalation Process

### Issue Escalation
1. **Level 1**: Agent attempts self-resolution
2. **Level 2**: Consult with dependent agents
3. **Level 3**: Escalate to orchestrator
4. **Level 4**: Team-wide discussion

### Decision Making
- Technical decisions: Relevant agents consensus
- Architecture changes: All agents approval
- Timeline changes: Orchestrator decision
- Quality compromises: Requires unanimous approval
